# RSG
Retro Stealth Game.

This is the source code for a game I'm currently working on that is reminiscent of the Metal Gear games of the NES, GBA era. 

Everything is being held up by placeholders and quick fixes for now. I refactor code, optimize code, and replace placeholder assets fairly often. So please don't take anything here as representative of the final product.

I also release test builds for feedback and bug finding fairly often, Check out my [releases](https://github.com/IliaBahmutov/RSG/releases), test builds are on both Windows and Linux. Although the game isn't optimized yet the game can be run on mostly anything.

lmao ignore the above this is hella abanonded. do whatever you'd like with it

If you do play any of the releases please do email me your thoughts on the game and any issues you encounter
