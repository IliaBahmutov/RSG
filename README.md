Retro Stealth Game.

This is the source code for a game I'm currently working on that is reminiscent of the Metal Gear games of the NES, GBA era. Currently It's mostly placeholders and half built mechanics but I one day hope to publish it on Steam, and if the hardware allows Android.

Everything is being held up by placeholders and quick fixes for now. I refactor and replace placeholder assets fairly often, so please don't take anything here as representative of the final product
